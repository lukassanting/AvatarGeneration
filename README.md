# AvatarGeneration
A hobby project in Python for the automatic generation of image avatars. Uses OpenAI's tools such as ChatGPT, and uses code from guides online, which are linked in each file.

There are two different ways of generating an image: one using the initials of a provided name, the other using AI generated images.
